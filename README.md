The Competition: WDSS Football Score Prediction
Predicting football match scores isn't a new concept; daily, countless fans wager at bookies based on mere guesses. However, the WDSS competition embraces a more data-driven methodology, inviting participants to showcase their best predictive models.

Format Overview
Participants make weekly predictions for each Premier League match, ranking their confidence in each score from 1 to 10. Scoring is determined by the weighted mean squared error of the predictions, which is then converted into points using a monotonously-decreasing rule. The goal is to identify the most accurate and reliable prediction models in the field.
